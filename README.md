# IPL Management System

## Introduction

The IPL (Indian Premier League) Management System is a simplified project designed for practice and learning purposes. It enables users to manage IPL teams, players, and matches while performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on in-memory data using `ArrayList`. This project is built with Spring Boot and does not utilize a database for data storage.

## Features

### For Teams:

- Add a new team
- View all teams
- View a specific team by ID
- Update a team's details
- Delete a team

### For Players:

- Add a new player
- View all players
- View a specific player by ID
- Update a player's details
- Delete a player

### For Matches:

- Add a new match
- View all matches
- View a specific match by ID
- Update a match's details
- Delete a match

## Workflow

1. **Run the Application**: Start the application on `localhost:8080`Â .
2. **Use Postman for API Testing**: Open Postman and create requests for the APIs listed above.
3. **Perform CRUD Operations**:
   - Use `POST` to create new teams, players, or matches.
   - Use `GET` to retrieve teams, players, or matches.
   - Use `PUT` to update details.
   - Use `DELETE` to remove entries.
4. **Test API Responses**: Verify the JSON responses and ensure data accuracy.

## Conclusion

The IPL Management System project provides a hands-on understanding of RESTful API development with Spring Boot. It allows users to practice CRUD operations and in-memory data handling, along with learning RESTful design principles and API testing using Postman.
